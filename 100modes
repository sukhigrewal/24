01. Intro: A normal day

Persimmon eucalyptus rosebuds
(Feelings are forever)

Blue tansy, tallow
(Cream in my coffee)

Neroli blossom pine
(Breathing...slow)

sandalwood-rosemary-apricot
(Precipice) 

Bless me (for,
I know not where I go)

palo santo
All the time

(Feelings cannot die)

02. I Do Not Exist

Cannot look
So almond sweet

In the shower
Underwater
Mirror of my cheeks

03. LIES. VANILLA.

Doe, a deer

I may be alone,
"it does not matter"
glowing ember, jewel in sky

I am so great
peach blossom, fig tree
cedar elm. 

I always mattered
the time is gone
these are the things
I remember

Oak, musk, turmeric, cumin
Bathing in milk and oil
Big oleanders and rabbits outside
Gunpowder and bullets in all the closets

04. forgiveness

unfairness
betrayal
replace with love
and the aroma of extract, geranium flower

that's it.

05. 


06. afternoon

coriander color in the summer
tall, papyrus, flower and tree

juniper berries 
big, whole berries the color of sea

07. acceptance

calm look
cardamom blushes
a little tired but excited

08. moving on

09. Dusk Flex

10. Outro: extinguish
